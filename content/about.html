        My name is Eric Jumper. 
        I am an IT Technician with CompTIA A+, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Microsoft Applied Skills: Administer AD DS Certifications. 
        While my bachelor's degree is in aviation, I have dedicated myself to becoming educated in the field of IT.

        In addition to my CompTIA, AWS & AD DS certifications 
        I've built a home lab to ensure I have hands on practice 
        building and troubleshooting provisioning virtual machines, 
        creating Active Directories and automating tasks with PowerShell scripts. 
        In my free time I have also provisioned local AI models including implementing RAG, Whisper and Web Search, 
        written my own firmware for my keyboard in C, 
        created a private cloud using Nextcloud on an Ubuntu server 
        and wrote the site you are on now using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

        While it may not seem directly relevant, I do believe my background in aviation equips me with a strong and uniquely useful skillset for the world of IT. 
        I have extensive training in risk management and mitigation. 
        I have hands on experience prioritizing and managing large workloads and solving complex problems in high pressure and even emergency situations. 
        And can read, understand and comply with complex regulations and policies.
