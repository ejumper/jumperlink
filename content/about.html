        My name is Eric Jumper. 
        I am an IT Support Technician with CompTIA A+, Network+, Microsoft Applied Skills: Administering AD DS and AWS Cloud Practitioner certifications. 
        While my bachelor's degree is in aviation, I have dedicated myself to becoming educated in the field of IT.

        In addition to my certifications 
        I've built a home lab to ensure I have hands on practice with essential network skills, such as 
        troubleshooting Windows, 
        DNS, DHCP and NAT configuration 
        and creating building and troubleshooting virtual machines

        While it may not seem directly relevant, I do believe my background in aviation equips me with a strong and uniquely useful skillset for the world of IT. 
        I have extensive training in risk management and mitigation. 
        I have hands on experience prioritizing and managing large workloads and solving complex problems in high pressure and even emergency situations. 
        And can read, understand and comply with complex regulations and policies.
