        My name is Eric Jumper. 
        I am a NOC Technician with CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+ certifications. 
        While my bachelor's degree is in aviation, I have dedicated myself to becoming educated in the field of IT.

        In addition to my certifications, 
        I've built a home lab to provide hands on practice with essential network skills, such as configuring and  
        troubleshooting Windows and Windows Server, 
        working with Linux Server and the Unix command line, 
        monitoring monitor uptime, bandwidth, latency and device health with LibreNMS, 
        configuring Graylog for centralized log aggregation with event-based alerting,
        and polling SNMP across network devices with traps.

        While it may not seem directly relevant, I do believe my background in aviation equips me with a strong and uniquely useful skillset for the world of IT. 
        I have extensive training in risk management and mitigation. 
        I have hands on experience prioritizing and managing large workloads and solving complex problems in high pressure and even emergency situations. 
        And can read, understand and comply with complex regulations and policies.
