    <h2>Demonstrated Skills</h2> <ul class="skills"> <li>Creating Virtual Machines</li> </ul> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>In this post I will outline my experience creating Virtual Machines using Oracle's VirtualBox. I have done this with several different OSs including Windows Server 2019 &amp; 2025, Ubuntu Server 24, Windows 11 &amp; Linux Mint, however, for the purposes of demonstration I will walk through the process of creating and configuring Windows Server 2019.</p> <p>As this will not be my first time installing Windows Server 2019 as a VM I will take the time throughout to note different problems I had in past installations &amp; how I addressed those problems.</p> <h2>Setup</h2> <p><strong>Downloading Assets</strong></p> <p>on virtualbox.org</p> <p>I downloaded hosts for my applicable host OS (Windows 11)</p> <p>Then I downloaded the VirtualBox extension pack</p> <p>Not strictly necessary but useful as I wanted to practice using VRDP</p> <p>on microsoft.com</p> <p>I download Windows 11</p> <p>I download Windows Server 2019</p> <p><strong>Installing VirtualBox</strong></p> <p>I went through the Setup Wizard and installed VirtualBox, it is straight forward and doesn't require any configuring beyond whether you want a desktop shortcut or not.</p> <p><strong>In VirtualBox Manager</strong></p> <p>I selected <strong>New</strong> to begin setting up the Windows Server 2019 VM</p> <p>I did some research on naming conventions for Virtual Machines and found <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/blogs/virtual-insider/2011/10/how-to-design-an-effective-naming-convention.aspx">this</a> website which outlined that a VM name should identify what the device is, its location and its purpose</p> <p>I figured since there was no question where the server was located I'd drop that and simply identify the device (WS19) and its purpose as a domain controller (DC) giving me the <strong>name</strong> WS19-DC-ADLAB</p> <p>I then <strong>selected the .iso image</strong> I had downloaded and turned off unattended install so that I could manually configure the hardware,</p> <p>on the next page I <strong>allocated 8GBs of RAM and 4 logical processors</strong></p> <p>my machine has 32GBs of RAM and based on my research the consensus off of various forum posts seemed to say that 8GBs of RAM would provide a smooth experience and leave me with plenty of room in case I decide to experiment with additional services or roles as well while also leaving enough resources to run the windows 11 VM and my host machine.</p> <p>As with the RAM the 4 vCPUs I allocated out of my 16 total logical processors is well enough over the minimum requirements that it should easily allow the Server to run smoothly and retain enough resources for the windows 11 VM and my host machine.</p> <p>for virtual hard disk space (after spending some time cleaning up my C: drive) I had 210GBs of free space so I allocated <strong>80GB of disk space</strong> for the server making sure to leave the "pre-allocate Full size" check box off so that it would only use as much as it needed up to 80GB. I came up with this amount based on a rough estimate of the space I would need based on what I planned to use the VM for plus around 20GB to leave a healthy margin of error.</p> <p><em>I originally installed the VMs on my much more empty D: HDD with more space, however this proved quite slow and it was well worth taking the time to free up space on my C: SSD as I more then made up the time spent in VM boot &amp; OS startup alone</em></p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518150645.png"></p> <p>before launching the server I went into <strong>settings</strong> to add a few features I wanted.</p> <p>under <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Tab</strong></p> <p>I changed the <strong>shared Clipboard</strong> &amp; <strong>Drag'n'Drop</strong> settings to <strong>Bidirectional</strong> to make make file transfer between the host OS and my VM a little simpler</p> <p><em>I happened upon this setting in when reading through the VirtualBox documentation after I had already done this lab a few times and it is a huge convenience. A testament to taking the time to look through the documentation <strong>before</strong> using new software</em></p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518153225.png"></p> <p>With everything configured. I can now <strong>select the WS19-DC</strong> on the left side panel under <strong>Tools</strong> and begin running the VM.</p> <p><strong>In the Windows Server 2019 VM</strong></p> <p>I verified the language &amp; keyboard settings &amp; selected <strong>next</strong> &gt; <strong>Install now</strong> to begin the Setup wizard.</p> <p><strong>In the Setup Wizard</strong></p> <p>I selected <strong>Standard Evaluation</strong> since I won't be using any of the Datacenter Editions features &amp; <strong>(Desktop Experience)</strong> in order to have access to the GUI. Then I accepted the license terms.</p> <p>I then select the <strong>Custom installation</strong> and progressed through the wizard until in began installing Windows.</p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518170118.png"></p> <p>With the server now Installed I create an Administrator Password and hit finish.</p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518170640.png"></p> <p>Now on the lock screen there is one final hurdle for the server as the Ctrl+Alt+Delete that should unlock the screen does not work.</p> <p>I says press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to unlock, however, this triggers the host device security screen instead.</p> <p>the solution is to go to Input &gt; Keyboard &gt; Ctrl-Alt-Delete and you will be presented with the password prompt to unlock</p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518172106.png"></p> <p>Now inside the OS I make some minor configuration changes to help the server run more smoothly in the VM</p> <p><strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Insert Guest Additions CD image...</strong></p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518172522.png"></p> <p>then in file explorer the first thing I always do as a matter of preference</p> <p>view &gt; show/hide &gt; check "file name extensions" &amp; "hidden items"</p> <p>then more importantly I navigate to <strong>This PC</strong> &gt; <strong>CD Drive (D:) VirtualBox Guest Additions</strong></p> <p>select <strong>VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64.exe</strong></p> <p>this installs a suite of drivers &amp; features within the VM that will be helpful</p> <p>allows you to create shared folders between the host and VM, improves performance a little, makes the mouse work better &amp; allows you to resize the screen.</p> <p>run through the wizard and hit <strong>Install</strong> &gt; <strong>Finish</strong> (I select I want to manually reboot later since the next step will involve restarting)</p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518174320.png"></p> <p><strong>Updates</strong></p> <p>Now I will perform the pending updates to the system. The quickest way to do this is to simply click the update icon on the right of the taskbar and click install now to install all the pending updates and once they're installed I restart again.</p> <p><img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250518205207.png"></p> <p><strong>Renaming PC</strong></p> <p>While not strictly Necessary for my own convenience &amp; to keep everything organized I will rename the PC</p> <p>in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>Rename this PC</strong> I give it the same name as the VM (WS19-DC)</p> <p>after selecting <strong>Next</strong> I restart the PC (if I had thought about it I could have done this before the updates and avoided the extra restart).</p>
