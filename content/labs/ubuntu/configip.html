    <h2>Demonstrated Skills</h2> <ul class="skills"> <li>configuring networks through Netplan</li> <li>setting file permissions in Linux</li> <li>reserving IP addresses</li> </ul> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>I plan to also setup DDNS to get access to my server from outside my network, but to start I will configure it to be reachable on my LAN by assigning it an static internal IP address.</p> <h2>Setup</h2> <p>Ubuntu stores network configurations through Netplan YAML files. You can edit these files to configure anything about the network configuration including how IP addresses are allocated. These files are stored in /etc/netplan so my first step is to run <strong>cd /etc/netplan</strong></p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Screenshot from 2025-06-03 09-45-47.png"> <p>Then I <strong>run ls</strong> to view the current network interfaces</p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Screenshot from 2025-06-03 09-51-46.png"> <p>the highest number at the beginning of a YAML file will be applied by default so in accordance with <a href="https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/explanation/networking/configuring-networks/index.html">ubuntu's documentation</a> I'll <strong>create a new netplan</strong> with the name <strong>99-static-ip.yaml</strong> by running...</p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Screenshot from 2025-06-03 11-04-57.png"> <p>I spent a fair amount of time figuring out how to write the network configuration (and as you can see found the terminal customization settings too) the only big deviation I made to the default configuration Ubuntu provides for Static IPs in their documentation is that I chose NetworkManager as my renderer because I am using a Wi-Fi connection and did not want the hassle of creating more files to manually authenticate the network. My understanding is that networkd is a little quicker and more efficient but I'm not running an enterprise network here, so I think I can take the hit.</p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250603234726.png"> <p>To choose my</p> <p>I chose my static address by typing my routers IP address into the browser, which brought up my router settings. I went to <strong>Home Network > Status</strong> to get the available internal IP network range.</p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Pasted image 20250603233435.png"> <p>I then went to <strong>IP Allocation > Found my device > selected Allocate</strong> and reserved the current IP address</p> <p>Next I verified the file security using...</p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Screenshot from 2025-06-03 11-37-23.png"> <p>I then used...</p> <img class="blog-img" src="content/labs/images/Screenshot from 2025-06-03 12-27-34.png"> <p>and verified I had a connection.
